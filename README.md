Find an API related to my project,I found bmi-APi
Started with the structure of the html and ensuring that all components are well linked i.e the javascript,style.css
Create an inbuilt weight conevertor which helpa convert the weight in pounds to kgs
Create the function using the javascript to allow the conversion
Create the form inputs i.e user name,weight,height
Incorporate the BMI function which will calculate by dividing the weight by the height and uotputing the result of whether normal,underweight,overweight and obese
Submit the user's input using the document.getElementById("submit");
Using the fetch the submit button will post the form inputs to the server 
event.preventdefault()will ensure that the submit does not behave in the default manner
After posting the data we will now fetch it back and display it
The user will be able to search their stored data using the search of the userid
The search will fetch the user'sname,weight,height and the comments the user entered
Create the function display
Using the inner html create the <li>i.e document.createElement("li");
Create the function searchByUsername()
Grab the search by using document.getElementById("searchResults");
Use the users.forEach(function (user)) to get the deatils for each user
Add the eventlistener to listen for the search by username
